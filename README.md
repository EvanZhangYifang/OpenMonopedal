## üîç Abstract

This work introduces a novel **parallel elastic actuation (PEA)** principle designed to provide **torque compensation** for legged robots. Unlike existing solutions, the proposed concept combines a **nitrogen (N‚ÇÇ) gas spring** with a **custom cam roller module**, enabling highly customizable torque compensation profiles tailored to specific leg joints.

An **optimization-based design approach** determines gas spring specifications and cam geometry to best match a target compensation profile. This mechanism was implemented and experimentally validated in the **knee joint** of a **two-degree-of-freedom (DoF)** monopedal robot actuated by **3D-printed cycloidal gear drives**.

**Key results** include:
- Effective generation of desired compensation torque profiles
- **71.92% reduction** in additional energy consumption from payload forces
- A **compact**, **easy-to-integrate**, and **customizable** solution for nonlinear torque compensation
